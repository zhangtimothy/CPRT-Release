Chess: Personalized Repertoire Tool

Hi! This is a program intended to help with creating, memorizing, and expanding your opening repertoire.  
  
I created this project because I wanted a personalizable way to apply repetition learning to memorize openings, and wasn't able to find a solution online. 
  
Check out the demo video below for a demonstration of features, as well as the intended way to use it(or at least the way which I've found to be the most useful).  
Demo video link (3 min watch): INSERT LINK HERE  
Installation video link: INSERT LINK HERE  

Features:
- Repertoires start empty, add only the lines that you want to learn
- Play lines on the board, and save them to the current repertoire with one click
- Training mode is a great way to learn: the CPU plays random responses from within your repertoire, and you must respond with moves that are within your repertoire
- Save comments for each position, to help you remember what your plans are in each position
- Much more, seriously watch the demo video :)

I hope you find this a useful way to improve your openings!

I used the Chess GUI made by javachessgui as a starting point, and heavily modified it to create this project.
