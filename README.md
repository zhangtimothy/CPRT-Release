Chess: Personalized Repertoire Trainer

Hi! This is an application intended to help with creating, memorizing, and gradually expanding your opening repertoire.
  
Check out this demo video:        https://youtu.be/D4QOOAh4cYQ

Here's an installation tutorial:  https://youtu.be/REz-Jdg4lo4

Features:
- Repertoires start empty, add only the lines that you want to learn
- Play lines on the board, and save them to the current repertoire with one click
- Training mode is a great way to learn: the CPU plays random responses from within your repertoire, and you must respond with moves that are saved in your repertoire
- Save comments for each position, to help you remember what your plans are in each position
- Much more, seriously watch the demo video :)

I hope you find this a useful way to improve your openings!
